# Summary: Artisan Fashion Consumer Preferences

## Objective

To explore consumer preferences for sustainable and artisan-made clothing, and determine if Aagati should emphasize limited-edition products or broader ethical positioning.

---

## Descriptive Findings

- Mean response for product design: **4.33**
- Economic conditions: **3.75**
- Limited editions: **3.52**

Respondents valued **design and sustainability** more than exclusivity.

---

## Hypothesis Test (Limited Edition)

**H₀:** μ = 4  
**Hₐ:** μ < 4  
**t = -6.58**  
**p < 0.001** → Reject H₀

Customers **do not** strongly prefer limited editions.

---

## Insights

- Stronger market support for **artisan quality + sustainability**  
- "Eco-friendly" is **weaker** than “sustainable” in perception  
- Price sensitivity observed, but design remains key motivator

---

## Recommendation

Aagati should:
- Emphasize design + sustainability in its brand message  
- Avoid “premium-only” strategy — niche positioning with accessibility is better  
- Educate customers on artisan value to overcome exclusivity barrier
