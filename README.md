# Business Insights Through Data: Sustainability Analytics

This repository showcases analytical work from the MBA course “Business Insights Through Data – DAT-3533 – FMBA1”.

The focus of the project is:
- Analyzing consumer preferences for artisan and sustainable products
- Hypothesis testing using t-tests
- Making business recommendations based on statistical outcomes

## Key Analyses

### Descriptive Statistics
- Analyzed survey results about artisan-made clothing
- Calculated means for product design, economic conditions, sustainability preferences

### T-Tests for Decision Making
- Tested if the average preference for limited-edition products is below market expectation
- Found that sustainability had **stronger support** than eco-friendliness
- Sample size: 247 respondents

### Example Test:

```text
H0: Mean = 4  
Ha: Mean < 4  
Sample Mean = 3.52  
t = -6.58 → Reject H0
