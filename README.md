## Key Analyses

### Descriptive Statistics

- Analyzed survey responses from 247 participants  
- Measured perceptions of:
  - Artisan product quality  
  - Limited editions vs. fast fashion  
  - Eco-friendliness vs. sustainability  

### Hypothesis Testing (T-Tests)

**Example test:**
- *H₀:* The average customer preference = 4  
- *Hₐ:* The average is **below** 4  
- *Result:* Mean = 3.52 → t = -6.58 → **Reject H₀**

**Conclusion:**  
Respondents **do support** artisan products, but have **lower preference for limited-edition items** than expected.
